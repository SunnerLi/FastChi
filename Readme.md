# FastChi – The Parallelized Fast Style Transfer toward Chi-chi video

Abstraction
---
The style transfer is a very popular problem in recent year. Moreover, there’re some application which use such kind of transferring into their product. However, the speed and performance are important issues that should be conquered. In Prisma, the smart phone should spend amount of time to transfer the image. To accelerate the style transferring procedure, we purpose the parallel structure toward this task, and speed up the procedure of transforming. The network will split the video as two parts, and use two GPU to transform the style to the content image in parallelism. For our expectation, the video which contains chi-chi (柴柴) will be transferred in very quick speed.
